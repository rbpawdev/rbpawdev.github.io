<h1>The Stations Of The Cross | The Way Of The Cross | Via Crucis</h1>            
<h5>As composed by St. Alphonsus Ligouri</h5>
<br>           
<p> Opening Prayer:<br>
<br>
ALL: My Lord, Jesus Christ,<br> 
<br>
You have made this journey to die for me with unspeakable love;<br> 
<br>
and I have so many times ungratefully abandoned You. But now I love You with all my heart;<br>
<br>
and, because I love You, I am sincerely sorry for ever having offended You.<br>
<br>
Pardon me, my God, and permit me to accompany You on this journey.<br>
<br>
You go to die for love of me;<br> 
<br>
I want, my beloved Redeemer, to die for love of You.<br> 
<br>
My Jesus, I will live and die always united to You.

        V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
            <br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider how Jesus Christ, after being scourged and crowned with thorns, was unjustly condemned by Pilate to die on the cross. (Kneel)
<br>
 <br>
  R: My adorable Jesus,<br> 
<br>
it was not Pilate;<br> 
<br>
no, it was my sins that condemned You to die. <br>
<br>
I beseech You, by the merits of this sorrowful journey,<br> 
<br>
to assist my soul on its journey to eternity.<br>
<br>
I love You, beloved Jesus;<br> 
<br>
I love You more than I love myself.<br>
<br>
With all my heart I repent of ever having offended You.<br>

Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

 <br>
 <br>V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)
<br>
V: Consider Jesus as He walked this road with the cross on His shoulders, thinking of us, and offering to His Father in our behalf, the death He was about to suffer. (Kneel)
<br>
<br>
R: My most beloved Jesus,<br> 
<br>
I embrace all the sufferings You have destined for me until death.<br> 
<br>
I beg You, by all You suffered in carrying Your cross,<br> 
<br>
to help me carry mine with Your perfect peace and resignation.<br>

            <img src="images/station-cross3.jpeg" height="500" width="400" alt=" The Third Station. | Jesus falls under the weight of the cross, a first time.">
            <br>
            V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider the first fall of Jesus.<br>
  <br>          
Loss of blood from the scourging and crowing with thorns had so weakened Him that He could hardly walk;<br> 
<br>
and yet He had to carry that great load upon His shoulders.<br>
 <br>           
As the soldiers struck Him cruelly, He fell several times under the heavy cross. (Kneel)<br>
<br>
R: My beloved Jesus, 
<br>
it was not the weight of the cross, but the weight of my sins which made You suffer so much.<br>
 <br>           
By the merits of this first fall, save me from falling into mortal sin.<br>
   <br>        
I love You, O my Jesus, with all my heart; I am sorry that I have offended You.<br>
   <br>         
May I never offend You again. Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

 <img src="images/station-cross4.jpeg" height="500" width="400" alt=" The Fourth Station. | Jesus meets his mother, and they were very sorrowful.">
<br>
V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider how the Son met his Mother on His way to Calvary. Jesus and Mary gazed at each other and their looks became as so many arrows to wound those hearts which loved each other so tenderly. (Kneel)<br>
<br>
R: My most loving Jesus, /
            by the pain You suffered in this meeting, / grant me the grace of being truly devoted to Your most holy Mother. / And You, my Queen, who was overwhelmed with sorrow, / obtain for me by Your prayers, / a tender and a lasting remembrance of the passion of Your divine Son. / I love You, Jesus, my Love, above all things. / I repent of ever having offended You. / Never allow me to offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

 <h2>The Fifth Station: Simon Helps Jesus Carry the Cross</h2>
 <img src="images/station-cross5.jpeg" height="500" width="400" alt=" The Fifth Station. | Jesus is very weak, so Simon is forced to help."> <br>
<br>
V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider how weak and weary Jesus was. At each step He was at the point of expiring. Fearing that He would die on the way when they wished Him to die the infamous death of the cross, they forced Simon of Cyrene to help carry the cross after Our Lord. (Kneel)<br>
<br>
R: My beloved Jesus / I will not refuse the cross as Simon did: / I accept it and embrace it. / I accept in particular the death that is destined for me / with all the pains that may accompany it. / I unite it to Your death / and I offer it to You. / You have died for love of me; / I will die for love of You and to please You. / Help me by Your grace. / I love You, Jesus, my Love; / I repent of ever having offended You. / Never let me offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

<br>
          V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider the compassion of the holy woman, Veronica. Seeing Jesus in such distress, His face bathed in sweat and blood, she presented Him with her veil. Jesus wiped His face, and left upon the cloth the image of his sacred countenance. (Kneel)<br>
<br>
R: My beloved Jesus, / Your face was beautiful before You began this journey; / but, now, it no longer appears beautiful / and is disfigured with wounds and blood. / Alas, my soul also was once beautiful / when it received Your grace in Baptism; / but I have since disfigured it with my sins. / You alone, my Redeemer, can restore it to its former beauty. / Do this by the merits of Your passion; and then do with me as You will.<br>

<br>
V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider how the second fall of Jesus under His cross renews the pain in all the wounds of the head and members of our afflicted Lord. (Kneel)<br>
<br>
R: My most gentle Jesus, / how many times You have forgiven me; / and how many times I have fallen again and begun again to offend You! / By the merits of this second fall, / give me the grace to persevere in Your love until death. / Grant, that in all my temptations, I may always have recourse to You. / I love You, Jesus, my Love with all my heart; / I am sorry that I have offended You. / Never let me offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>
<br>
(Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be.)<br>

V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider how the women wept with compassion seeing Jesus so distressed and dripping with blood as he walked along. Jesus said to them, “Weep not so much for me, but rather for Your children.” (Kneel)<br>
<br>
R: My Jesus, laden with sorrows, / I weep for the sins which I have committed against You / because of the punishment I deserve for them; / and, still more, because of the displeasure they have caused You / who have loved me with an infinite love. / It is Your love, more than the fear of hell, / which makes me weep for my sins. / My Jesus, I love You more than myself; / I am sorry that I have offended You. / Never allow me to offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

<br>
V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider how Jesus Christ fell for the third time. He was extremely weak and the cruelty of His executioners was excessive; they tried to hasten His steps though He hardly had strength to move. (Kneel)<br>
<br>
 
 
R: My outraged Jesus, / by the weakness You suffered in going to Calvary, / give me enough strength to overcome all human respect / and all my evil passions which have led me to despise Your friendship. / I love You, Jesus my Love, with all my heart; / I am sorry for ever having offended You. / Never permit me to offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<BR>

V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br>
<br>
R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br>
<br>
V: Consider how Jesus was violently stripped of His clothes by His executioners. The inner garments adhered to his lacerated flesh and the soldiers tore them off so roughly that the skin came with them. Have pity for your Savior so cruelly treated and tell Him: (Kneel)<br>
<br>
R: My innocent Jesus, / by the torment You suffered in being stripped of Your garments, / help me to strip myself of all attachment for the things of earth / that I may place all my love in You who are so worthy of my love. / I love You, O Jesus, with all my heart; / I am sorry for ever having offended You. / Never let me offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

<br>
R: My dying Jesus, / I devoutly kiss the cross on which You would die for love of me. / I deserve, because of my sins, to die a terrible death; / but Your death is my hope. / By the merits of Your death, / give me the grace to die embracing Your feet and burning with love of You. / I yield my soul into Your hands. / I love You with my whole heart. / I am sorry that I have offended You. / Never let me offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

<br>
R: O Mother of Sorrows, / for the love of Your Son, / accept me as Your servant and pray to Him for me, / And You, my Redeemer, since you have died for me, / allow me to love You, / for I desire only You and nothing more. / I love You, Jesus my Love, / and I am sorry that I have offended You. / Never let me offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

My good and dear Jesus, <br>

a deep and lively faith, hope, and charity,<br>
