            ALL: My Lord, Jesus Christ,<br> 
            You have made this journey to die for me with unspeakable love;<br> 
            and I have so many times ungratefully abandoned You. But now I love You with all my heart;<br>
            and, because I love You, I am sincerely sorry for ever having offended You.<br>
            Pardon me, my God, and permit me to accompany You on this journey.<br>
            You go to die for love of me;<br> 
            I want, my beloved Redeemer, to die for love of You.<br> 
            My Jesus, I will live and die always united to You.

            V: Consider the first fall of Jesus.  Loss of blood from the scourging and crowing with thorns had so weakened Him that He could hardly walk; and yet He had to carry that great load upon His shoulders. As the soldiers struck Him cruelly, He fell several times under the heavy cross. (Kneel)<br>
            <br>
            R: My beloved Jesus,/ it was not the weight of the cross, but the weight of my sins which made You suffer so much./ By the merits of this first fall, save me from falling into mortal sin./ I love You, O my Jesus, with all my heart;/ I am sorry that I have offended You./ May I never offend You again./ Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br>

            V: Consider how Jesus Christ fell for the third time. He was extremely weak and the cruelty of His executioners was excessive; they tried to hasten His steps though He hardly had strength to move. (Kneel)<br>
            <br>
            R: My outraged Jesus, / by the weakness You suffered in going to Calvary, / give me enough strength to overcome all human respect / and all my evil passions which have led me to despise Your friendship. / I love You, Jesus my Love, with all my heart; / I am sorry for ever having offended You. / Never permit me to offend You again. / Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<BR>
