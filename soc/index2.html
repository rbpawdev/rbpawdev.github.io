They were faithfully and soundly bestowed upon it by the Fathers. nor has the faith only just been established, but it has come to us from the Lord through His disciples. May what has been preserved in the Churches from the beginning to the present day not be abandoned in our time; may what has been entrusted into our keeping not be embezzled by us. Brethren, as custodians of God's mysteries let yourselves be roused into action on seeing all this despoiled by others."
