          The First Station: Pilate Condemns Jesus to Die
        </h1>
        <p class="lead">
          V: We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You. (Genuflect)<br><br>
          R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br><br>
          V: Consider how Jesus Christ, after being scourged and crowned with thorns, was unjustly condemned by Pilate to die on the cross. (Kneel)<br><br>
          R: My adorable Jesus, it was not Pilate; no, it was my sins that condemned You to die. I beseech You, by the merits of this sorrowful journey, to assist my soul on its journey to eternity. I love You, beloved Jesus; I love You more than I love myself. With all my heart I repent of ever having offended You. Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br><br>

          R: Because, by Your holy cross, You have redeemed the world. (Rise)<br><br>
          V: Consider Jesus as He walked this road with the cross on His shoulders, thinking of us, and offering to His Father in our behalf, the death He was about to suffer. (Kneel)<br><br>
          R: My most beloved Jesus, I embrace all the sufferings You have destined for me until death. I beg You, by all You suffered in carrying Your cross, to help me carry mine with Your perfect peace and resignation. I love You, Jesus, my love; I repent of ever having offended You. Never let me separate myself from You again. Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br><br>
